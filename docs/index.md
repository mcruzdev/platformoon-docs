# Introduction

The goal of this repository is to document the creation of a simple Internal Developer Platform for me (Platformoon). 

This repository is a collection of documents that explain the different parts of the platform, decisions, and how I build it.

## Why?

I am a Software Engineer at MercadoLibre and I am working on the Cloud & Platform TEAM creating developer toolings on top of Fury (an internal platform here), it is a great experience for me. 

With this initiative I want to learn more about Kubernetes, Dagger, Crossplane, ArgoCD, etc. I want to create my own platform to learn more about CNCF toolings and to share it.

!!! Disclaimer

    I know that it is not a real platform, but I want to learn more about this topic and I want to create my own platform to learn more about CNCF toolings and to share it.

## Platform Engineering on Kubernetes Book

I am creating this repository having as a reading/reference the book [Platform Engineering on Kubernetes](https://www.manning.com/books/platform-engineering-on-kubernetes) by [Mauricio Salatino](https://twitter.com/salaboy). 

I contributed with some part of the code sample of the book in this [repository](https://github.com/salaboy/platform-on-k8s) and feel free to contribute too.
