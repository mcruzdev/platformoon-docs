# Introduction

I want that the architecture should be simple and easy to understand. I want to use the power of Kubernetes to create a simple platform that can be used by developers to deploy their applications.

I will use a monolithic architecture to create the platform. Is simple to start and to understand too.

## Architecture

The architecture will be composed of the following components:

- Kubernetes Cluster
- Platformoon API (GoLang)
- Platformoon Frontend (NextJS)
- Platformoon CLI (GoLang)
- Platformoon Pipelines
- Platformoon Documentation (mkdocs)
- Keycloak


The main goal here is to learn and to get out from comfort zone. I hope that you can learn something too.
