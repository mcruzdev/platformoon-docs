# What we need first?

Before all, I think that we need to define what initial applications types we need to support.

We will support only backend applications written in [Go](https://golang.org/) only.

The application will be those fields:

- Name
- Description
- Repository URL (Generated by the platform)
- Technology
- Kind (backend)

It is all, we do not need to support initially more than one backend application type. We will get the feeling configuring pipelines, deployments for one application type and then we will be able to extend the platform to support more application types.
