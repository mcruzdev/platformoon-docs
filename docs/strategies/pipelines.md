# Pipelines

To run our Platform pipelines I want to use GithubActions + Dagger. Dagger is a tool that allows us to run our pipelines locally. Dagger was born with this main goal: 

> “to enable developers to build pipelines using their favorite programming language that they can run everywhere”.

I like this because we can use the power of the GoLang combined with the power of Dagger to create our pipelines.

## What we need first?

I think that is a good idea to create a repository to store all our pipelines. This repository will be called `platformoon-pipelines`. I will do it manually with Github.
